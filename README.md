## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned
- This project got me familiarized with the concept of SASS as well as its syntax.
- I also learnt the Window addEventlistener(DOMContentLoaded) object and it was helpful in implementing the slider on mobile devices

### Continued development

After being exposed to to SASS and its superpowers, I would love to delve more into partials and mixins alongside every other useful information I need.


### Useful resources
- [SASS documentation page](https://sass-lang.com/)- This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand SASS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
